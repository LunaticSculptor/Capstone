# Space Y Rocket Launch Analysis
In this self-directed learning initiative, I assumed the role of a data scientist for Space Y, a nascent rocket company with aspirations to rival SpaceX. The project revolved around determining the launch cost by predicting the successful recovery and reuse of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage. Commencing with data gathering, I curated information on SpaceX launches, meticulously examining success rates, mission parameters, and other pertinent details. Employing machine learning methodologies, I trained a predictive model to assess the probability of first-stage recovery. Subsequently, I created insightful dashboards to visually represent key findings, facilitating informed decision-making for the Space Y team. This self-learning endeavor delved deep into the technicalities of rocket launches, providing a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies involved in making data-driven decisions within the commercial space industry.
